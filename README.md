<h1>Work Day Scheduler</h1>

I created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule<br>
WHEN I open the planner<br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar<br>
WHEN I scroll down<br>
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours<br>
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day<br>
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br>
WHEN I click into a timeblock<br>
THEN I can enter an event<br>
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock<br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage<br>
WHEN I refresh the page<br>
THEN the saved events persist<br>

<br>

**Note: This demo is showing non-standard business hours in order to capture the functionality.**
